**6\.  	Other Relevant Experience**

I run my own consultancy company, Ludogogy, which specializes in gamification and AI interventions for organizations.  This allows me to perform independent consultancy to retain my connection to industry, and help government and NGOs navigate issues related to AI and engagement.  I have an active portfolio of ongoing collaborations with a number of Universities, Research Institutes and private companies. Current and past research collaborations include: New Zealand Royal Society, MBIE, DIA, Reserve Bank of New Zealand, NZQA, NZ Ministry of Health on AI and previously on the Covid Tracing App, Ministry of Education on AI in Education and Games for Education, ACC, University of Auckland, Flick Electrical, University of Groningen (The Netherlands), Coventry University (UK), University of Southampton, Tallinn University (Estonia), Fraunhofer IDT (Germany), KLM (The Netherlands), Zombie Cat studios (US).  I was also part of the Academic Exchange for Progress (AEP) project funded by the Norwegian Foreign Ministry as a collaboration with the Balkan states of Macedonia, Kosovo, and Albania, which includes staff and student exchange. 

**7\.	Research Expertise**

My two main areas of expertise are Serious Games and Artificial Intelligence. Serious Game development is a very interdisciplinary area where my research covers both the design and development of games, user experience research, and the use of games for non-entertainment purposes.  The specific areas of game development include: Design, HCI, Software Architecture, Computer Graphics, parallel programming, web development and game theory. 

I have supervised three PhD students to completion, the titles were “Augmented Reality Serious Gaming for Cognitive Health”, “Facilitating and Advancing Universal Design of ICT”, and “Minigames for Mental Health”.  All of these involve using technology to help address societal challenges: cognitive health, mental health, and accessibility, using AI to help model and improve the analysis 

I have supervised many Master's theses on various topics including games for autism, ADHD, dementia, epilepsy, sleep quality, cyber security, tourism, cosmetics, and Virtual and Augmented Reality.

I am currently supervising eight PhD students, four as primary and four as secondary.  All of these are in New Zealand, the four primary are in Engineering and Computer Science: “Virtual Reality and simulation sickness”(submitted), “Social VR for children during medical isolation”, “VR for mitigation of loneliness in migrant communities”, “Gamification of memory training in the Elderly”;  Second supervisor on (ECS) “Evolutionary-based neural architecture and LLMs”,  (SoDI) “Designing games for specific senses”, (Health) “Sleep stories for managing insomnia”, (Health) “Dynamics of Dairy Worker interactions”.  I have also taught PhD courses for 5 years in Serious Games (5 ECTS), and seminars in Data Visualisation and English writing for Science, and courses in Digital Ethics.

My current research includes: AI in education, games for cognitive health, games for mental health, Virtual Reality for education and collaboration; games for mental health; gamification of energy use and carbon footprint; and incentive systems for education.

I have also been investigating new teaching methods for Computer Science including focusing on questioning as the primary activity of a computer scientist. I have been researching various assessment techniques for assessing meta-knowledge and understanding through students' questioning ability.
