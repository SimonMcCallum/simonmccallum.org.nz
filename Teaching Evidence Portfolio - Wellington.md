# Teaching Evidence Portfolio

# Dr. Simon McCallum

## Pepeha

Ko Taranaki te maunga, where my father is an educational psychologist.  Ko Ōtepoti te tāone where my mother was a teacher, and I started my journey as a tertiary student and as a lecturer.  Ko Mjøse te roto is the lake in Norway where I grew into my mana as a lecturer. Ko Te Herenga Waka mahi ahau.

Teaching and learning has been a continuous part of my lived experience since I sat in the back of my father’s class at the age of 3\. I teach because it is who I am not what I do. I teach not to demonstrate my ability but to create a learning environment which supports students and helps them achieve. I see my role as the mentor, the “guide on the side” not the “sage on the stage”[^1], I am a “lead learner”[^2].

My specialisation is teaching all aspects of game development.  Games are the purest form of user experience.  There is no other purpose to play than the experience.  Teaching game development has informed my teaching practice to be radically student focused and emphasise engagement and motivation.  My teaching has been molded by the desire to understand motivation and the intricacies of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, environments that support engagement, and the role of reflection and meta-knowledge in learning.

Learning is joyful, however much of modern education is not joyful for our students.  They have been schooled in the process of conforming to Learning Outcomes set without their input and irrelevant to their interests.  These are like games they would not play, if it was not for the extrinsic motivation of  a qualification that leads to a career.  

I consider excellent teaching to be the ability to reignite the joy of learning by supporting students and removing barriers to learning. To negotiate the handing over of control of the learning environment to the students and to support their journey. 

This portfolio covers the principles that underpin my educational approach, selected examples of operationalizing those principles in the learning environments I create, and the supporting evidence of the effectiveness of this approach.

*“As an overseas exchange student, Simon was the best lecturer I've ever had with making me feel welcome and supported to study. His lectures are captivating, thought provoking and pushed me to get results that I never even thought I was capable of achieving.*”   Daniel Fox, Programmer Rockstar Games, student in 2015

## Principles of Learning

The core of my approach to learning is to increase student motivation to learn, encourage reflection on knowledge, and emphasise the social aspect of learning. I base my teaching on a mix of social constructivism, Self Determination Theory (SDT) ([Deci & Ryan](%20https://doi.org/10.4135/9781446249215.n21) 2012)[^3], gamification[^4], and Vygotsky’s Zones of Proximal Development.

### Student motivation

Motivated students are able to learn outside the classroom, and to take control of their own learning outcomes.  I use SDT to help understand how to migrate students from being controlled extrinsically by grades, punishment, and fees, to autonomous intrinsically motivated learnings. 

SDT has three pillars: **agency**, **competence** and **relatedness**. In discussion with the office of the DVC Māori, Āwhina Māori student support and the Faculty of Engineering's Māori assistant lecturer Kevin Shedlock, we discussed how these could potentially map to: mana motuhake (agency) , pūmanawa (accomplishment), and manaaki (caring and relatedness).  A cultural difference between Te Ao Māori conception and Western concepts is that in Te Ao Māori these three psychological categories are linked and do not exist in isolation. Thus, when trying to motivate, we must engage all three aspects. Unfortunately many assignments focus merely on the “competence” element independent of agency and relevance to the wider community.  For collectivist cultures, such as Māori, and Pasifika, the focus on a single aspect of motivation does not support their learning.

*“He would always show interest in my culture, me being Maori and Pacifica, he was always trying to find ways of improving the learning experience for maori/pacifica and he would ask for my input which is something no one else in the CompSci/Engineering department has ever done.”*   Michael Tololi, graduated 2019\.

Self Determination Theory has shaped in my implementation of Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington's [**Learning and Teaching Strategy**](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/documents/policy/strategies/learning-teaching-strategy.pdf%20). Which is informed by the national Tertiary Education Strategy and National Education and Learning Priorities.

**Akoranga** ( a collective responsibility for learning ), specifically point *1.1 Explicitly teaching students how to learn and how to communicate complex ideas effectively within courses, and supporting them to develop skills for university study*.  I support student agency by engaging students in the creation of learning goals, weighting assessment and ordering topics.   This is part of mentoring students to take control of their own learning.

**Whanaungatanga** (collaboration) : *2.4 Using innovative, accessible pedagogically informed digital technologies to complement face-to-face learning and teaching*, is critical to the response to COVID-19.  I have been recording and streaming lectures and providing them in different formats for over 20 years. In the early 2000s I started podcasting my lectures using an mp3 recorder and a hand coded RSS feed. In the past year alone I have used Panopto, Camtasia, OBS, Youtube, Twitch, MS Teams, Zoom, and Discord for video lecture streaming. I have used many real time feedback systems including gosoapbox, kahoot, socrative, dotvoting, issue voting in gitlab, Discord, Zoom chat, Twitch chat, YouTube comments, Google Q\&A and a bespoke system I created called [QRate](http://gtl.hig.no/qrate/admin.php).

These tools also support student collaboration with each other.  This is critical for pushing to the edge of the zone of proximal development, as students learn from each other as well as from me.

My experimentation with different platforms is both a search for effective tools and a way of providing students with different learning environments.  Every student should experience different learning environments to find the tools and systems that work for them as learners. This experimentation is not random, but connected to an intentional plan to reflect on the benefits of each system.

**Whai mātauranga** (exploring existing and creating new knowledge): *3.3 Growing and developing the teaching and incorporation of mātauranga Māori across the University.*  
I have been learning ways of incorporating mātauranga Māori in my courses from my students, my colleagues, and the wider community. The work on reframing the principles of SDT in Te Ao Māori is part of that commitment to mātauranga Māori.

Manaakitanga emphasises the relatedness and connection to areas that are important to each student.  This can be seen in the projects which are used in my courses and connection with the students’ interests.  I use game development as a way of grounding abstract theory in the practical experience of my students.  The vast majority of my students have spent significant time playing computer games.  By connecting abstract concepts to their lived experience I am able to use a constructivist approach to building knowledge that is relevant to the student.  Asking students to compare and contrast books, when the only books they have read are those set as part of classroom teaching, provides no insight into their own lives.  Using games as the material for comparison allows knowledge and skills learnt to be transferred to their lives.

A recent example of this is bringing research into the SWEN422 Human Computer Interaction class. The students provided feedback to the project managers in the Ministry of Health responsible for the NZ Covid Tracer app.  The ministry shared the design for future releases which was later rolled out to 2.5 million users in New Zealand.  By including the students in the evaluation of the designs and setting up the meeting with the ministry I connected the learning in Human Computer Interaction with meaningful change in society.

*“I think the lecture has been really good, having real world examples to relate to the theory has been helpful and also something that is also so relevant right now helps to engage with the content. I think the fact that the lecturer went out of their way to organise this is quite big given that the Ministry of Health, no doubt, is under a lot of pressure and for them to spend the time to talk to us is pretty huge”*  
Student quote on facebook from SWEN422 

### Meta knowledge

Accurate meta-knowledge of confidence allows students to know when to ask for help and when to forge ahead. This is a critical part of learning to learn. In computer science most of the content in our courses is available online.  The value of the University is not in being a repository of knowledge, but in helping students learn to ask the right questions and understand the answers.  Meta-knowledge is the key to asking good questions, and knowing when to ask.

I use the concept of teaching meta-knowledge to help shape both my presentation of topics and my assessment systems. I make explicit the goal of building confidence in your knowledge by identifying multiple sources of justification.   This also requires the students to question concepts which lack support. 

Accurate meta-knowledge leads to students asking authentic questions. Answers to these authentic questions are more likely to be retained than answers to questions that students had never thought of.[^5] 

### Social constructivism

*“working in groups teaches people how to communicate, student-driven content, lots of student feedback throughout the course”* Student feedback SWEN303, 2020

Modern computer science is a social activity. Social constructivism emphasises the role of building knowledge in relation to dialogue with others. Professional programming requires communication with other programmers and the construction of knowledge shared with others. Working in groups, code reviews, peer reflection and explaining concepts to group members allows concepts to develop and helps identify holes in a student’s understanding.  

This emphasis on the collective also aligns with Te Ao Māori where knowledge and meaning are deeply culturally linked to other people. As a lecturer I encourage and support group learning activities and create supportive environments for students to learn from each other, to extend into the zone of proximal development.

## Operationalising Principles

I am constantly looking for new ways to express my learning principles within the spaces I create.  There are too many to express them all but a selection include: 

### Agilification of teaching

*I really loved the flexibility of the course content. It allowed students to learn what they wanted to (within reason).Course feedback was always welcomed through the trimester.*  Student feedback SWEN303 2020

To provide students with flexibility and agency I use an Agile methodology within my teaching.  This includes transforming the normal language of education ( topics, tests, and misunderstanding) into the language of software project management (features, milestones, and bugs)

As part of this remapping I put the topics of the course into a backlog, this contains the new features (topics) which need to be learnt.  The students vote each week on which topic is most relevant and interesting for them.  They can also add new topics to the list, and if the rest of the class vote for that topic, it will be selected as the focus of the next learning week.  

Having the group vote on the topic order also reinforces the importance of social interaction. The students can see what is important to the group and that what is taught is not purely the perspective of the lecturer.  

### Rubric negotiation and weighting

*“Simon's ablility to be flexible is great for example his use of multipule platforms for streaming his lectures. As well as he letting us having a choice on content and how important each subject is. Best lecturer I've had\!”* Student feedback SWEN 303 2020

This student is commenting on the choice of rubric categories and rubric weighting. Rather than defining the rubric before a course starts, I create flexibility and agency by allowing students to have input on the assessment criteria. 

I present the rubric for assignments in a draft form.  The students are asked “Does this rubric include all the elements **you** want to be assessed on?”  This has the benefit of the student agreeing to be assessed on these categories, or adding a new category if they feel there is an important goal not covered.    

Having established these agreed rubric, students can individually adjust the weighting for each part of the rubric. Each category has a minimum, maximum, and default weight.

The assessment is graded with each category marked out of 10 and then scaled by the weighting. For example if there are 4 categories with default% \[range\] :

* Introduction	20% \[10 \- 30\]  
* Methodology	25% \[15 \- 35\]   
* Results	30% \[20 \- 40\]   
* Discussion	25% \[15 \- 35\] 

A student could decide that the Results and Discussion were critical and select (10, 15, 40, 35).  If they score well in these sections it will increase their final grade reflecting their meta-knowledge about the quality of their work.

Students are able to both plan to spend more time on specific parts of the project, and during submission to reflect on which aspects they excelled at. This supports agency, competence, and meta-knowledge.

### Group work with Animal Avatars 

“the 'team roles' were super useless, especially in comparison to the animal roles last year which were great.” Student feedback, COMP313, 2019

This student is commenting on the comparison between traditional “team roles” used in 2019 and the Animal Avatar model used in 2018\. Seven years ago I created a group collaboration system for group projects. The theoretical foundation of the system is a combination of McClelland's Three Needs Theory and SDT.  It uses 6 animal avatars which are a tangible manifestation of behaviours that are beneficial in groups.  

### Six animal avatars

Bear \- The leader, speaks when nobody else speaks

Puppy \- The enthusiast, supports all ideas and looks for opportunities

Owl \- The processor,  ensures that meetings keep moving forward

Wolf \- The manager, tells the bear to “shut up” and makes sure everyone is participating

Cat \- The cynic,  risk averse and identify what might go wrong

Rabbit \- The facilitator, makes sure the group has everything it needs.  
This allows students to move quickly through the “storming phase” of group formation. Providing roles to every member of the group creates a fairer distribution of work.  Each role has special abilities and responsibility.  The students have agency in selecting which animal role they will fulfil during that project, and after the animal roles have been selected each team is created as a group of six different animals.  This also helps create groups with a diversity of interaction styles, as different student profiles select different animals to align with.

The cognitive separation of the student from the role in the group also provides a buffer from criticism, as comments can be directed at the role rather than the student.  These animals also lighten the mood and remove some of the stigma associated with the traditional role labels.

### Confidence assessment in grading

An important part of learning is reflection.  I have innovated by including confidence as part of the grading system.  For exams I have used two forms of confidence indicator, one for multichoice questions and one for short answer exams. 

For Multichoice questions with 5 options I use a confidence indicator of 1, 2, or 3 per question. The grading system uses the confidence of the student to change how each question is graded

| Confidence  |   Correct | Wrong |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1   |   1 |  0 |
| 2  |   1.5 | \-0.5 |
| 3   |   2 | \-2  |

Thus a student answers both the question and their confidence in their answer.  An example could be  Q1. A 3 and Q2. B 2\.  If A is the correct answer to Q1 the student would get \+2 .  If they get Q2 wrong (C was correct) then the student would score \-0.5 bringing their total for the two questions to 1.5.

This system provides rich feedback for the lecturer around the student’s quality and depth of understanding.  Students who can merely recognize an answer cannot judge the appropriate level of confidence. 

Meta-knowledge is used in short-answer and essay questions by creating sections each worth a similar amount. Students can nominate one of the sections as a **bonus** section which will increase its weighting by 50% and a **weak** section which will shrink to contributing only 50% of its original weight.  This keeps the total marks available the same, and rewards students for the ability to identify the quality of the answers they give.  This benefits students who can identify their weaknesses.  The goal is not about rank order change it is about having the students think about their work.

These approaches support student autonomy by reinforcing the ability to identity when you do not know something, and therefore need to learn. It also provides an excellent opportunity for the lecturer to approach students to discuss confidence in their work.  Students who have low confidence can be identified and encouraged, while students who are overconfident can be approached to discuss strategies for identifying weaknesses.   
   
I presented this approach as part of the [Transforming Assessment](http://transformingassessment.com/events_3_march_2021.php) webinar series (185 registered  60 attending, educators from around the world).    
“Good webinar this morning (8:00 AM Flushed face), very helpful to get students in teacher training more actively involved by agreed assessment.” Pieter Snel, Hogeschool Inholland, Attendee of Transforming Assessment via Twitter

“I can say it was a great session and the conversation was richer than normal given it went on for 30 minutes afterwards” Mathew Hillier, Transforming Assessment Chair.

## Other innovations

**Digital exam** \- Gave presentations to the Faculty of Law and the Centre for Academic Development on the use of Inspera for digital exams. I ran a midtrimester term test using gitlab as a digital exam platform with open internet access.  The students preferred the exam to normal paper exams (22 vs 13\) with 27 vs 8 preferring open internet exams to closed exams.  This is a viable option for online digital exams.

**Teaching from within VR** \- I have given lecturers and part of courses to students from within Virtual Reality.  I am wearing a Head Mounted Display and my students in Norway are also in Virtual Reality Headsets.  We meet in a virtual classroom created by my Masters students.  The code that creates the virtual environment is also open for the student to demonstrate their learning by changing the virtual classroom. (published IEEE VR 2021\)

**Ethics in the lounge** \- Using the student pub ( Hunter lounge at Te Herenga Waka ) as an open lecture location for the ethics lectures in each of the courses I teach.  This allows a more relaxed and open discussion than a classroom, and connects the courses to the wider community.

**Meeting the students** \- I have been providing online streamed content to my students by finding where they are.  Each year I ask which is the dominant streaming platform for the students in the class.  In 2018, 2019, and 2020 that was Twitch, in 2021 the vote changed to Zoom as all students had become familiar with Zoom as a tool. By using Twitch I had been meeting the students where they were, rather than forcing them to come to us.

## Evidence of impact

Having been teaching for over 20 years I have had impact both on my students and community.  In Dunedin the Regional Development Fund project CODE ($10 Mill) is a direct result of my creation of a Game Development course in 2004\. Many of the game companies operating in Dunedin are led by the graduates of that course. 

Within the University one of the challenging problems is how to accurately assess the impact of an educational intervention.  Students develop over time regardless of the quality of the learning environment. This is confounded by exams and assessments often lacking ecological validity and having low positive predictive value of real world ability.

The most standardised form of evaluation is course and lecturer feedback during teaching.  There are issues with this sort of evaluation as these are both easily manipulated and do not capture the long term changes that are the focus of creating active student learners. However there is value in comparison when the data acquisition process is respected.

My personal lecturing reviews continue to be strong.  The first semester teaching in Wellington for overall teaching performance in SWEN303 User Interface Design I have a 1.6, a course I had never taught before, and 1.1 for COMP313 Computer Game Development which I have been teaching similar courses for 16 years. 

SWEN303 as a course had an overall of 3.1 in 2018\.  Taking over the course in 2019 it improved to a 1.6, and a 1.2 in 2020 during the lockdown trimester.  My ability to respond to the change in teaching format was mentioned by several students:

*During the pandemic went out of the way to keep the interest of the students. With Twitch sessions which assured students it was all fine and that the lecturer was on top of it. This gave a lot of us students the confidence that this subject isn't panicking, in turn, it kept the students pretty chill and have a good time doing the subject.*  Student feedback SWEN303 2020

*This is the best structured course out of all my courses.*  
*The course was quickly adjusted to adapt to the current pandemic.*  
*We went online even before the university did.*  
*The way the course assessments were structured also meant that it was essentially the same even after the COVID-19 break.* Student feedback SWEN303 2020

The last comment here was interesting.  Although the students did not notice a change, behind the scenes I made changes to the assessment criteria, assignment requirement and deadlines.  The fact that the students did not notice the significant change is the result of a significant amount of work and clear messaging. 

I am particularly proud of receiving a 1.2 for a course which included group work where the groups were formed during lockdown without the ability to meet in person.  This required additional lectures on group behaviour and remote collaboration.

### Negative student feedback

There is also much to be learnt about a lecturer by the negative comments.  The flexibility and student agency is not alway the preferred learning environment for the students:

*I found that, ironically, sometimes Simon was a bit too generous about asking us for our preferences. It was a generally positive experience, but it could lead to a bit of insecurity at times having these decisions left in student hands. Sometimes a teachers authority is reassuring and helps students to trust their experience. This is more about feelings than teaching I suppose.* Student feedback, SWEN303 2019

Negative feedback is also constructive when innovating.  My use of Gitlab as an online exam system in SWEN422 had problems.  These were to do with communication about the time, and amount of socialising of the new exam style with students and lecturers.  Some students really enjoyed the exam, but others found it problematic. 

In assessing performance you cannot only look at the things that work well.  Innovation should occasionally fail as without failure you cannot be sure if you are testing the boundaries.

## **Kāore te kūmara e kōrero mō tōna ake reka (The kumara does not speak of it’s own sweetness)**

**Professor Stephen Dobson, Dean of the Faculty of Education**

Dr. Simon McCallum belongs to the next generation of higher education academics who does not research ‘on’ the teaching and learning of students, he brings students and colleagues into his world so they collectively develop, trial and calibrate their learning and teaching ‘in’ and ‘with’ him in a shared environment. The following extract in the recent Assessment Framework discussion document presented to Academic Board (August 2020\) by Walbran, Schofield and Dobson was directly inspired by and acknowledges Simon’s contribution to teaching, learning and assessment:

*The student-centred approach to learning and assessment is founded upon the view that student agency and motivation involves actively taking part in not only learning, but also assessment.  In future-proofed student-centred learning, students are actively involved in the choice of their learning resources, lectures and accompanying assessment criteria, rubrics and assessment situations. Much is also to be gained by understanding the student as more than the self-directed, autonomous individual. The student is always inter-connected in some way with other students (e.g. encountering the same learning resources) or with whanau, Iwi and communities. This is a central premise in a successful student-centred learning and assessment environment, where students are supported and not overwhelmed by responsibilities placed upon their shoulders to be self-directed and motivated learners (Damşa and De Lange, 2019).  Moreover, learning is both reinforced and enhanced when opportunities for differentiated learning and assessment trajectories are offered to students in accordance with their interests, skills, needs and cultural backgrounds.*

Higher education has for far too long been dominated by teacher centred views of teaching, learning and assessment. Those seeking a student-centred approach on the other hand, would greatly benefit from the experience of Simon as they design new courses and programs to meet student driven learning processes. 

Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington is privileged to have a colleague such as Simon.

**Daniel Brown, founding member of VUW's Pasifika Pathways Governance Board**

I am a founding member of VUW's Pasifika Pathways Governance Board, and one of my roles is to interview Māori and Pasifika students who have enabled their cultural voice to resonate in their student work. This achievement relies on the insights and encouragement of academics, like Simon McCallum in the Faculty of Engineering, who truly believe in the importance of cultural capital. Engineering is a discipline that seems furthest from offering cultural opportunities, yet Simon's students have truly flourished under his watch. Simon's Engineering student Michael Tololi recently graduated and uses his engineering skills to develop mobile computer games that help enhance mental health in the Māori and Pasifika communities. Current student Olivia Morrison is developing a new app with Simon that enables people to track their carbon footprints––one important step in mitigating sea level rise that is threatening Pacific communities. Through Simon's approaches to teaching, his community engagement, and his outreach to alumni, Simon has helped Engineering give a voice to Māori and Pasifika culture in ways that will have an ongoing impact on the future of these communities.

**Tayla Cook, Kaitakawaenga Māori | Māori Liaison Officer**

I initially met Simon two years ago at one of our SRAO Regional Information Evening events. His role at this event was to impart his knowledge onto prospective students surrounding our Engineering pathways and from his engaging personality – he was then invited back to help deepen our relationship with Careers Advisors within the Auckland region. His ability to humanise our university system from a macro to a micro level is essential to building relationships amongst students, their families and the communities they stem from.

Knowing of his personable skills, Simon was a key recruit to inform the setup of our engagement site for the 2019 Te Matatini – National Senior Kapa Haka Competition, the biggest Māori festival in the world, here in Wellington. We needed to create the best first impression as the university of the capital and we were grateful of Simon to help contribute to our space. His approach to creating a hybrid of video gaming, virtual reality and pure enjoyment helped to re-imagine Māori recruitment, leaving our education site sustaining high volumes of crowd interaction.

When thinking of new innovative ways to engage with our students, Simon has always been at the top of my mind to help be that sound board for me. Whether it is experience with online engagement, creating a virtual connection with Te Herenga Waka or challenging my own ideas on how to communicate with communities – I can always count on Simon to support these potential ideas into a reality.

From experience, I have seen Simon be instrumental to demystifying tertiary studies by helping all students to be open to a career in technology. The university should be proud to know that an academic like Simon McCallum is on their staffing list. In conclusion, I acknowledge Simon’s continued commitment to his role thus supporting his nomination for the 2020 Teaching Excellence Award.

I Graduated at Victoria University in 2019 with a BSC majoring in Computer Science. In my final year I was fortunate to be taught by Simon McCallum in SWEN 303 user interface design and COMP 313 computer game development.

Simon's approach to lecturing is both innovative and inspirational. He provided a lot of tools so that I was never forced to turn up to lectures. He set up live streaming with online interaction and recorded lectures in more than one format. However, the way he delivered his lectures were so interesting that his lectures were the only ones I would turn up to. The way he set up his assessments were one of the most helpful tools that I still use today in my current role. We were assessed on teamwork and reflective learning through written essays.

Simon is very approachable and respectful. He is one of the only lecturers who I would have long but interesting discussions with. He would always show interest in my culture, me being Maori and Pacifica, he was always trying to find ways of improving the learning experience for maori/pacifica and he would ask for my input which is something no one else in the CompSci/Engineering department has ever done.

Simon is the only lecturer who I have recommended for future maori/pacifica students to be taught by and what he teaches is relevant. Today I am a Technical Specialist with the BNZ bank, a lot of the tools and methodologies such as GitLab, Agile and DevOps are what I use in my day to day.

Since returning to New Zealand and taking up a post at ECS in 2018, Simon has excelled not only in the courses he is teaching but also in his ability to reach out to other academics both within and outside of ECS to effect change.

Talking firstly about the courses, Simon took over a difficult assignment of fixing SWEN303, a course that had begun to suffer poor course evaluations in the years preceding his arrival due to several staff trying to take on the group-based, design-led nature of the course, and not being able to properly motivate the students or deal with what can be the more subjective nature of human-computer interaction (both in assessment and also in answering students’ questions on material). Simon rapidly turned that around and his innovative work on group formation was one key aspect to this.

Simon quickly shared his experiences and his techniques with other staff on how to form teams effectively, which had previously been often led to either random chance or to student choice, both of which could lead to sub-optimal teams.

Simon has also excelled in re-imagining COMP313 and working alongside his Design colleagues to create a vibrant and successful inter-disciplinary and group-based project course where students from two different academic cultures (ECS and Design) have been able to successfully interact and complement each other.

This has led to the Dean of Engineering – Prof Dale Carnegie – rightly having the confidence to task Simon with designing an entire Masters programme and redesigning the undergraduate major in graphics for the Faculty , despite the fact that this would typically fall to someone more senior in the A/Prof or Prof range.

Simon has also been a strong representative for the Wellington Faculty of Engineering on the Teaching & Learning Committee and has also been an active contributor to forums where he has proposed novel assessment ideas, such as his use of more nuanced multi-choice questioning to assess not just “correctness” but also “confidence”.

Simon is a trusted and valued teacher within the School and is easily one of our most innovative and forward thinking educators. He is highly engaged with many activities around the School, and another one that is directly tied to any one particular course is his attendance at, contributions to, and commitment towards, the issues of equity and inclusion. Simon has contributed to this both at the student-engagement and also the wider staff-culture level, and is one of our most frequent attendees and contributors at the regular ECS Equity Hui.

I fully endorse and support Simon’s application for a Teaching Excellence Award. His combination of excellent teaching scores (on challenging group-based and inter-disciplinary courses), his commitment to innovative teaching practices (and both learning from them, and then sharing that learning openly), and his contributions to the teaching culture and service roles in the School and Faculty, make him a very worthy nominee.

SWEN303 student 2021 \- 

I learnt a lot about accessibility in this course which I really value. It is so easy to be close minded and unaware of struggles people face day-to-day when you do not face them yourself. But I feel as though my eyes have been opened in understanding some of the difficulties for those with impairments and how that might affect their use of technology. Awareness is the first step to being more inclusive in terms of accessibility, and many other aspects of diversity, which is something I am grateful to have learnt more about and will only strive to continue growing that knowledge.
